This was an individual project made by me and executed in 5 days.
I did this project within 5 days in our unit-4 construct week. BuzzBuy is a ecommerce product based website  in USA that allows customers to purchase products in massage & personal care, home, travel, gifts, and more.
BuzzBuy is a chain of retail stores in the United States and China. It was founded as a mail-order business in 1965, when it started selling items, such as dental clamps and other specialty tools.
It has expanded to several product & offers for customers, as well as a few free offers provided by us if customers purchase mass product.
